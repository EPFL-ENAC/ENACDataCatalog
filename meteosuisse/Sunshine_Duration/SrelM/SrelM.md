![preview](${base_url}/meteosuisse/Sunshine_Duration/SrelM/SrelM.png)

SrelM and SrelY are spatial analyses of monthly and yearly relative sunshine duration in Switzerland for a multi decadal period (1981-present). 
The analyses integrate in-situ helio-meter measurements (about 70 stations) and high-resolution satellite data to provide an effective spatial resolution near the km-scale.
