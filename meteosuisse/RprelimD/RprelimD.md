## Daily Precipitation (preliminary analysis)

### Variable
Daily precipitation on day t, corresponding to rainfall and snowfall water equivalent accumulated from 06:00 UTC of day t to 06:00 UTC of day t+1. In millimeters (equivalent to liters per square meter).

### Application
Real-time precipitation monitoring. Water resources and hydropower management. Hydrol-ogy, agriculture and tourism. 

### Overview
RprelimD is a near real-time analysis of the distribution of daily precipitation in Switzerland. The analysis for a day becomes readily available on the following day. Its restriction to real-time measurements implies that RprelimD is a “preliminary analysis”, which is superseded by a more reliable “final analysis” from all (including manual) measurements after a delay of about one month (see RhiresD). RprelimD is addressed to qualitative or semi-quantitative applications in water resources and hydropower management.
