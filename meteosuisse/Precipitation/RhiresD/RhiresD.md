# RhiresD - Daily Precipitation

![preview](${base_url}/Precipitation/RhiresD/RhiresD.png)

RhiresD is a spatial analysis of daily precipitation covering the entire territory of Switzerland and extending over a multidecadal period (1961-present). 
It provides detailed spatial information and high accuracy by exploiting all available (i.e. automatic and manual non-realtime) measurements (typically 420 each day). 
Apart from basic monitoring, RhiresD serves a broad range of planning tasks where quantitative process models with precipitation input are used.
